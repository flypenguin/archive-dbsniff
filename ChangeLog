2005.11.13

	* (esniff): changed default flag behavior: is now "-p", and multiple
	  flags are possible (though it's stupid). 

2005.07.10

	* the use of Sleep()/usleep() is a Windows/non-Windows issue, not
	  a compiler one (fixed bug in winwrap.h)
	* added (working) dev-c++ project files for loss_chk/loss_srv

2005.07.02

	* created visual studio project files for all programs (run fine)
	* revisited directory structure (msvc, devcpp)
	* added readme files for visual studio & devpp
	* added project files for extsniff,nwait,npush for devcpp 

2005.07.01

	* (extsniff) re-validated the old dev-c++ project file for windows, 
	  along with a readme file containing information about compiling the 
	  thing. the other programs (wdate, etc.) will follow soon.

2005.01.30

	* (extsniff) summary mode now counts the complete packet size in
	   pack_size field, including ethernet headers. 
        * (extsniff) verbose output was modified a bit in summary mode.

2005.01.23

	* (extsniff) fixed bug in "display contents" mode which would 
	  occasionally print [0] bytes even if the packet carried no paylaod.

2005.01.22

	* (extsniff) throughput mode added / made working. very good :-)

2004.11.25

	* (extsniff) fixed some nasty bugs in the main packet capturing event 
	  loop

2004.11.17

	* (extsniff) fixed duration calculation bug in summary mode.
	* (extsniff) added -x switch to reverse reference IP meaning

2004.11.04

	* EXTSNIFF DAY
	* gen: cleanups and bug fixes in main loop
	* gen: got rid of db stuff (enable again with -DUSE_DB)
	* gen: removed extdump from vc++ workspace
	* usability: implemented output to file
	* usability: reworked & changed usage flags quite massively
	* print header mode: beautified output
	* print header mode: added times since start / last packet via -v
	* summary mode: massive code cleanup 
	* summary mode: beautified output 
	* summary mode: added "average packet sending distance in ms"
	* summary mode: implemented both average payload and packet size
	* summary mode: implemented both payload and size distribution
	* BUG FIXES, BUG FIXES, ...

2004.09.20

	* 18:18h CET: UPDATE
	* fixed critical bugs in loss_srv, completely changed network 
	  communications to be more reliable and robust. 
	* added payload size display for control
	* added thousands of (#ifdef _DEBUG ... #endif)'s for better debugging
	  :-)
	* added continuous option to loss_srv and a possibility to reset the 
	  thing. 
	* fixed loss value output: was between 0..1 instead of 0..100
	* added some debug outputs
	
2004.09.17

	* added tool for loss-checking communication channels based on 
	  npush/nwait code. works fine :)
	* fixed spelling error in npush help ... 

2004.09.14

	* added wdate executable for displaying useful date strings (including
	  unix time seconds) in windows
	* renamed windows.c/h -> winwrap.c/h, linux.h -> linwrap.h
	* replaced (UNCHECKED) windows.h with winwrap.h in all files ....... 

2004.09.02

	* Summary mode: added average payload size
	* average size ONLY takes packets with ANY payload into account - so all
	  packets NOT having payload are NOT taken into the calculation
	* fixed bugs
	* fixed compiler warnings
	* fixed gcc / msvc printf() imcompatibility concerning %llu and %I64u
	  by defining a macro in windows.h / linux.h

2004.09.01

	* fixed bug in summary mode
	* marked broken features broken ...
	* added multiple use of -D for "increased" output on summary mode
	* deleted configfile code (was not used anyways)
	* got rid of some compiler warnings

2004.08.31

	* added npush / nwait in linux Makefile
	* added windows.c, windows.h and linux.h to provide some wrapper 
	  functions to eliminate the need for #ifdef WIN32 concerning network 
	  functionality

2004.08.26

	* added -s switch for nwait. nwait will only exit if npush 
	  had the same string set. quite good for preventing race
	  conditions :-)

2004.08.25 

	* added npush and nwait, VC++ only yet, no linux makefile
	* added -h help option of npush / nwait
	* website changes

2004.08.11

	* hands on throughput mode: should work again. removed
	  debug stuff & fixed the calculations. 

2004.08.09

	* deleted extdump from linux makefile
	* added -S mode ("S"ummary mode)

2004.07.22 

	* ported to ms visual studio .net - devcpp wouldn't debug any more :-)
	* old dev-cpp project file should STILL be valid!!
	* relies on the following directory structure: 

		<parent>
			|
			---> csniff
			|    |---> src
			|
			|--> wpdpack (winpcap lib)
			|
			|--> db-4.2.52.NC (berkeley db)
			     |---> build_win32
			           |--->Debug_static
			           |--->Release_static    
			           
	* tested: extended throughput mode.
	* untested: database mode, throughput mode. though the latter should
	  still work without flaws, but the dump tool MAY have to get rewritten.
