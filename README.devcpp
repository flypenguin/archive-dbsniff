COMPILATION NOTES FOR DEV-C++
=============================

1. put the developer's edition of winpcap in the dbsniff directory
2. adjust the path settings of ... :
    - the winsock library
    - the wpcap library
    - all the include paths 
   in the project settings
3. compile the project file, which should simply run through now.

if that's not all ... well, you're on your own :)
