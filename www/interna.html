<h3>Saving of information in statistical mode <span
 style="font-style: italic;">(incomplete
and obsolete)</span></h3>
<br>
The statistics are simple: based on a time interval it counts all
sniffed packets (supported are <span style="font-style: italic;">only</span>
tcp and udp packets!), and saves the sum of all these packets in a
Berkeley DB database.<br>
<br>
The data is split into tcp/udp bytes/packets in/out, which is saved for
every port &lt; 1024 separately. So within the database the assignments
are as follows: <br>
<pre style="margin-left: 40px;">[ time | port | IP ] --&gt; struct db_val<br></pre>
As you can see the traffic is divided into the different services the
machine encounters. Plese do not assume a sophisticated port detection
algorithm - the "smaller" port number from the packet (src/dst port) is
taken. The IP safed is the IP of the <span style="font-style: italic;">other</span>
machine - the program is not (yet) ready for sniffing on a
switch/hub/router. It has to have an "own" IP address - the one of the
machine it is running on, so it can discard this one - so a router
wouldn't be possible (again: yet). <br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Warning: the following information is
mostly obsolete ... :-) Go on to the next chapter.</span><br>
<br>
There is a second mode which is called statistical mode. In this mode
extsniff simply counts <span style="font-style: italic;">every single
bit</span> which is sent on the line per second. This is a very basic
throughput sniffing. The information is saved in a file, which is done
by writing the following struct into it every second:<br>
<pre style="margin-left: 40px;">typedef struct {<br>    unsigned int time;<br>    unsigned long long int bps;<br>    unsigned long long int pps;<br>}TPData;<br></pre>
Note that the statistical mode is different under linux than under
Windows. WinPcap offers a statistical mode for doing those things,
(linux) Pcap does not. The data gathered can be extracted with the
accompanied tool <span style="font-weight: bold;">extdump</span>,
which creates a comma
separated values file with the data, which can be imported into almost
any spreadsheet / statistical program. Note that those programs aim to
be platform independant, it uses ANSI C
and libraries available on many systems, at least Linux and Windows.<br>
