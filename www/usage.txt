USAGE

this describes only the throughput standard mode for now. 

basically the throughput mode is available via the "-t" switch. 
the throughput timespan has to be set via the "-d" switch and has to be
given in MICROSECONDS. the timespan is the time for which the throughput 
calculation applies. basically the formula:
                bytes_seen / timespan
is used for calculation, based on the capture time stamp of the first packet. 
example: in the capture files are four packets in one second, one each 0.25
seconds. let each packet be 1000 bytes in size (including all headers, also 
ethernet!). set the timespan to 500000 with "-d 500000" to set half a second
as base. 
then the sniffer will see two packets in the first half (again: relative to
the first packet timestamp of the capture file), adds up the bytes and counts 
the packets.
when seeing the third packet (from which the timestamp is more than half a 
second after the first one), it will calculate the following: 
        2000 bytes / 0.5 seconds = 4000 bytes / seconds
        2 packets / 0.5 seconds  = 4 packets / second
and output this information.
